PANOPTICON CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES PROPOSAL

SUMMARY:

In this proposal, I'd like to explore the matter of containment policy. When an Altered Item enters the Oldest House, we thoroughly investigate any possible combination of actions or words or material that will prevent the item from applying its altered effect.

However, I work with these entities every day and I have good reason to believe that a less convoluted form of containment is possible. The items crave [REDACTED]. If we initiated a series of [REDACTED] praising the items, or perhaps incorporating their images into pieces of [REDACTED] that could be visited throughout the Bureau, I believe the Altered Items would behave without needing to resort to [REDACTED] or [REDACTED], which only lead to the items feeling mistreated. 

If we treat them like criminals, we can’t be surprised when they try to escape.
