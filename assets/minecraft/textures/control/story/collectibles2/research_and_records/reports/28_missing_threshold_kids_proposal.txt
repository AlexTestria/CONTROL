INITIATIVE PROPOSAL

THE “THRESHOLD KIDS”

PROBLEM:

With the recent arrival of the [REDACTED], there are certain glaring gaps in the Bureau's ability to educate and raise a young [REDACTED]. There are no other [REDACTED] for [REDACTED] to play with and [REDACTED] is expected to learn about a frightening new concepts.

SOLUTION:

[REDACTED] will require a slow, [REDACTED]-friendly introduction to paranatural topics. With this in mind, allow me to introduce the Threshold Kids, a television show in which a cast of cheerful puppets explain the dangers of living at the Bureau, but also show the fun side of the paranatural!

Budget would be minimal. I took a few puppet-making courses at my local community center. We can have research staff build the sets, record the footage, and even do the voices. It will be good for morale, and I guarantee [REDACTED] will respond positively to these videos. We can't expect a [REDACTED] to enjoy lectures and people in lab coats. But, as television has proven for years, [REDACTED], love puppets!
