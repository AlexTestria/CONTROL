INCIDENT REPORT

RE: QUARRY OPERATIONS

SUMMARY:

During my weekly safety inspection to the Quarry Threshold, I discovered the entire crew in a state of [REDACTED]. The whole team was [REDACTED] aligned and staring in a uniform direction; the City in the distance. Despite my most vocal efforts to gain their attention, they remained [REDACTED] for more than [REDACTED] minutes until I had to resort to literally [REDACTED]. Afterwards, they were dazed and could not provide any rationale for their behavior or any specific memories of engaging in it.

My official recommendation for any crew working in a Threshold area is to either shorten the length of their shifts or to carry out mandatory psychological evaluations on a weekly basis — or preferably both.

And maybe we should order another expedition to the City.
