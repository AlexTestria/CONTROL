INVESTIGATION ORDER - CLASS 5

SUBJECT: BLESSED REPAIR AND SERVICE

CAUSE FOR INVESTIGATION:

The Songmaster Jukebox (OOP10-KE) came to the Bureau's attention through a local radio piece regarding Tex's Roadside Diner and the events that transpired there. Every diner reported being temporarily being transported to an undetermined location that they later described as a sandy coastline. The Bureau took custody of the object the same day. The diners were told a gas leak was responsible for their imagined beach vacations.

In an interview with the diner's owner, it was discovered that the albums in the object had been replaced the day before the event by a service responsible for the machine's upkeep, who only left the single [REDACTED] record inside. Agents attempted to track down "Blessed Repair and Service" but could find no company by that name in the state.

ACTION TAKEN:

"Blessed Repair and Service" has been added to the list of outstanding investigations. Any and all information on this business, its employees, or any known associates should be forwarded to Mr. [REDACTED] in the Investigations Sector immediately.
